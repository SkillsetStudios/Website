    <section class="about-me">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a dedicated and results-driven Statistician with a strong foundation in data science, statistical modeling, and machine learning. Holding a Master's degree in Statistics from UC Davis and a Bachelor's degree in Statistics from UCLA, I have honed my expertise in advanced statistical techniques, including regression analysis, time series forecasting, and unsupervised learning. My work experience spans across the U.S. Department of Labor, where I apply my statistical skills to improve public health and safety outcomes in the mining industry. I am proficient in a range of tools and programming languages, including R, Python, Excel, Tableau, and MicroStrategy, which I use to analyze complex data, create interactive dashboards, and generate actionable insights. In addition to my technical abilities, I am highly skilled in presenting complex data findings to both technical and non-technical stakeholders, fostering collaboration and driving data-informed decision-making. My passion for leveraging data to solve real-world problems is complemented by a strong work ethic, attention to detail, and a commitment to delivering high-quality results.</p>

            <p>The COVID-19 virus has evolved into several variants including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron over the past two years. Delta and Omicron were named Variants of concern by organizations like the CDC. Despite vaccinations and mask-wearing, infections became more common with Omicron, but the infections were mild in most people. The primary concern is the death rate, and the project aims to investigate if there is a difference in death rates between Delta and Omicron and if vaccination rates affect the death rates of these variants.</p>
